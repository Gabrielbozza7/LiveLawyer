// WARNING: If changes are made to this file inside a volume, the container should be rebuilt with the changes reflected

// directory on the host, excluding the volume-specific changes in ".devcontainer/devcontainer.json".
// SPECIFICALLY FOR THIS "devcontainer.json" FILE, note that the only difference between the host version of this file
// and the one in version control should differ only in volume mounting if you are using a volume.
