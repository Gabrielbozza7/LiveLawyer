# LiveLawyer Repository

## Initial Setup

When you are first setting up the repository to work with your computer, you should visit these guides in the following order:

1. [GitHub SSH Key Setup](./docs/github_ssh_key_setup.md)
2. [Repository and Dev Container Setup](./docs/repository_and_dev_container_setup.md)
3. [EAS Setup for iOS](./docs/eas_setup_for_ios.md)
4. [Twilio Information](./docs/twilio_information.md)
5. [Supabase Information](./docs/supabase_information.md)

You might also want to take a look at [Guidelines](./docs/guidelines.md) and [Unfinished Business](./docs/unfinished_business.md), but those are not part of the initial setup process.
